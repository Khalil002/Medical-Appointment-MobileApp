# Medical-Appointment-MobileApp
Medical appointment mobile application programmed in Flutter with Firebase for the backend.

## Usage
In order to run this project, you will need to do the following:
- Create a FirebaseDB instance to hold the data (schemas and everything)
- Link the flutter project with your Firebase backend
- Compile and run the flutter project in your phone

Someday I might come back with a script to do this automatically.. Hopefully...
